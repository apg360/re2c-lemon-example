int main() {
    int x;
    x = 3;
}

For the computer it's just a meaningless sequence of characters :
int•main()•{\n\tint•x;\n\tx•=•3;\n}\n



First step divides the text up into individual "tokens".
Characters/letters become tokens/words :
<span style="color:red"> *int*</span>

main
(
)
{
int
x
;
x
=
3
;
}
