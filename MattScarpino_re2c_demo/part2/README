The code for this article generates a parsing application for SimpleC. It's provided in an archive called lemon_demo.zip, which contains four files:
- simple_c.re - lexer definition file, re2c can use this to generate a lexer
- simple_c_grammar.y - SimpleC grammar file, Lemon can use this to generate parsing code
- test.dat - Contains C code that can be successfully parsed
- Makefile - Contains instructions for generating the lexer and parser and building the application

If you have GNU's make and gcc utilities, you can execute the make command. This will read the Makefile instructions and automatically build the application.

If you want to build the application manually, you need to perform three steps:
1. Use Lemon to generate parser code from the grammar (lemon simple_c_grammar.y)
2. Use re2c to generate the lexer code (re2c -o simple_c.c simple_c.re)
3. Compile the lexer and parser code (gcc -o simple_c simple_c.c simple_c_grammar.c)

The application parses the code in test.dat. In addition to printing messages to standard output, it uses ParseTrace to print state messages to trace.out.
