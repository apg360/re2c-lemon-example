The code for this article generates a simple application that scans simple C code. It's provided in an archive called re2c_demo.zip, which contains four files:
- simple_c.re - lexer definition file, re2c can use this to generate a lexer
- tokens.h - associates each token with an integer value
- test.dat - Contains C code to be scanned
- Makefile - Contains instructions for generating the lexer and building the application

If you have GNU's make and gcc utilities, you can execute the make command. This reads the Makefile instructions and automatically builds the application.

If you want to build the application manually, you need to perform two steps:
1. Use re2c to generate the lexer code (re2c -o simple_c.c simple_c.re)
2. Compile the lexer code into an executable (gcc -o simple_c simple_c.c)

As the application runs, it reads characters from test.dat and prints information about each token it recognizes.
