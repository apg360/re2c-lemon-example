	main.c
		Input can be read 1 of 2 ways. From a file ./main <file> or
		if no file is given from the two strings  'buff' and 'buff2'.
		buff2 contains a divide by zero error and a parse error
		to see how parse.y handles these situations.

	lexer.l
		Valid numbers, token NUM, are defined with the following
		regular expression:
		([0-9]+|([0-9]*\.[0-9]+)([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?)

		This includes the following:
		5.2
		5.2e2
		5

		This is taken care of in the lexer.l.   "yylval.dval" is used
		to return a type double token to the parser. Note, since this
		is type double, parser.y defines yylval as  "%union { double dval; int vblno }". 
		Without this definition, yylval will return an integer.  This is used
		for both NAME tokens and NUM tokens.

		Variables: [a-z], one letter only, and note the second use of yylval as yylval.vblno 
		via the union statement in parser.y
		
	parser.y
		This is an example of explicitly specifying the precedence level.  Yes, it
		can also be done with the grammer; but, that would have required an additional
		rule.
		"%left '-' '+'" 
		"%left '*' '/'" 
		
		 
	

	Makefile
		-lm option is needed for math.h
		Kyle R. Burton <mortis@voicenet.com> made interesting use of 'test -e' and mv
