 A very simple example of a lexical analyzer definition.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file "easy.qx" defines some rudimentary patterns as they may occur in a
programming language ('struct', 'int', 'expect' etc.). Using 'make' the 
engine 'EasyLexer' and all of its related files are generated by Quex. The
file "../example.c" implements a very basic user of the lexical analyzer. 

When 'make' finished its job, there is an executable './lexer'. This can 
be run like

    > ./lexer  example.txt

Producing a display of the analyzed data.
