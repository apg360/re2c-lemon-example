lemon-example

	An example of using a tokenizer and a grammar to validate date
	expressions; for example, "Jan 30 through Feb 15 at 8pm".

	The tokenizer is plain-old C and a lemon grammar [0] is used to
	generate the parser. 

	Lemon is written by the same author  as SQLite. It's benefis include
	a simpler grammar than yacc, thread-safety, and a looser coupling
	with the tokenizer.
    
	This repository was started from David Wheeler's C port [1] of a 
	C++ lemon tutorial [2].   The core of the tokenizer was copied 
	pretty much verbatim from Troy Hanson's lemon example [3].

Status

	Functional.  See the files test_tokenizer.sh and test_isadate.sh
	(in the regress directory) for examples of strings that are handled.

Build

	make

		Builds an object file that provides the method

				int isadate(const char *, struct emsg *);

		which returns 0 if the string is a date, and 1 otherwise.

		If the string is not recognized as a date, the emsg struct is 
		populated with an error message and a column index.


Test

	make test
